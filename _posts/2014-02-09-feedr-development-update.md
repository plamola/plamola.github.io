I've been quite busy building this 'FeedR' application. Most of the work done so far is the stuff most people will never see, like fetching the actual contents of RSS feeds and implementing API's so mobile clients can connect to the application. While it is nowhere from being complete, the background stuff is on hold for the moment, so I can concentrate on building the frontend.

Finally I get to see if all the work I've done so far can be made into something usefull.

Still needs a lot of work, but its fun to do, so who cares, right?
