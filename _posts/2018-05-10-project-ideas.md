I have some ideas for projects I'd like to do. And share how or what I did to finish the project


### Hardware

* Heron deterrent

  To prevent herons from eating all the fish in our garden pond, I've bought a cheap, solar-powered heron scare device. 
  It does not seem to do anything. 
  Time for some upgrades.

* Leg detector

  In the winter it can get quite chilly in my home office. To counter this, I have installed a infrared heater under my desk. But I have to turn it off manually, when I leave the office. 
  That is something which should be easy to automate, with some hardware.


### Online

* Revise websites

  Over the years I accumulated a list of domain names but I am not using them all. Time for a cleanup maybe?
  

* No more VPS

  Every month I get a bill for the Virtual Private Server (VPS) I am renting. Lets see if we can lower that bill, or not get a bill at all.



### Learn

* Kotlin

  Apparently Kotlin can be used to create Android applications, which is something that is missing for Scala. Lets get some experience with Kotlin first, before dabbling with Android apps.

* Serverless

  Installing and maintaining servers has never been much fun for me. Make sure I never have to do that again and go 'serverless'.
  
* React

  The last front end work I did was with Angular v1. Upgrade time.
